### What is Hey day?

Hey Day is a tradition celebrated every year by handing out name tags and encouraging students, faculty, and the rest of the Auburn Family to greet one another, bringing all members of Auburn closer together. 

### Origins

Dating all the way back to 1947, students who served in WWII were returning back to normalcy at Auburn University, but upon their return, they felt unseen and unheard on campus. In response, Auburn University’s student body and members of the Student Government Association pushed for a day that would unite the Auburn Family and promote a friendly atmosphere known as Hey Day – a day where every student got the opportunity to wear a name tag, helping everyone feel a sense of belonging.
